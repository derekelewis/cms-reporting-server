# CMS Reporting Server

cms-reporting-server is a service that I wrote a few years ago to load various CMS data sets into a
database and generate adhoc reports. The service is written to use Spring Boot & Spring Batch.

Data sets supported include:

* Meaningful Use Public Use Files (PUF)
    * Provider Attestations
    * Provider Payments 
* NPI Data
* Hospital Cost Reports
